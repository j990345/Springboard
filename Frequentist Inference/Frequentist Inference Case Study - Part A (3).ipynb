    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

Scaling our estimate of the variance by the factor $n/(n-1)$ gives an unbiased estimator of the population variance.

    "Remember, we rarely (if ever) actually know our population parameters but we still have to estimate them somehow. If we want to make inferences to conclusions like \"this observation is unusual\" or \"my population mean has changed\" then we need to have some idea of what the underlying distribution is so we can calculate relevant probabilities. In frequentist inference, we use the formulae above to deduce these population parameters. Take a moment in the next part of this assignment to refresh your understanding of how these probabilities work."

    "__Q11:__ Using this fact, calculate the probability of observing the value 1 or less in a single observation from the standard normal distribution. Hint: you may find it helpful to sketch the standard normal distribution (the familiar bell shape) and mark the number of standard deviations from the mean on the x-axis and shade the regions of the curve that contain certain percentages of the population."

We remind ourselves that another result from the CLT is that _even if the underlying population distribution is not normal, the sampling distribution will tend to become normal with sufficiently large sample size_. (**Check out p. 199 of AoS if you need to revise this**). This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places. In reality this is simply a rule of thumb; if the underlying distribution is approximately normal then your sampling distribution will already be pretty normal, but if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed then you'd want to increase your sample size."
